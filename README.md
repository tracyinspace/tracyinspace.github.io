# I didn't plan on writing a readme for my personal website, but here we are...

If you need to read this, I probably did a bad job.

## About the website

Hopefully on this website you'll be able to learn a little about me, my professional interests, maybe even find an answer to a question. I love writing/reading code, DevOps, and corgi puppies. Also coffee.

## Cool things that this website will have (Kind of my to-do list)

- Create a space game and include it in the website
- Make my website repo public
- Portfolio of projects
- Include fun gists
- Include my 100 question quiz, open source it!
- Update the website with Jenkins and an ansible playbook
- Do a database thing
- Initial State producitivity dashboard
- Link to Zack's trello article? Link to Initial-State I'm a trello evangelist
